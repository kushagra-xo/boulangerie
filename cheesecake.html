	Blueberry cheesecake is a rich, creamy, and not too sweet dessert with a nice touch <br>
	of tang. It's a decadent but not too heavy dessert that everyone will love.         <br>
	It's relatively easy to make but looks and tastes fantastic. That makes it an       <br>
	excellent choice for both formal and casual events.                  
	</p>

	</p>

	<h3>Steps:</h3>
	<h4>Preparing the Cheesecake Filling</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Start by preparing the cheesecake filling. Combine the cream cheese        <br>
			and sugar until smooth. Stir in the sour cream and lemon juice (if using). <br>
			Add the blueberries and mix until just combined. Do not overbeat or your   <br>
			cheesecake could be mealy or crack
		</li><br>

		<li>
			Pour the batter into your prepared pan and bake for 45-50 minutes. <br>
			Let the cheesecake cool to room temperature before chilling for at <br>
			least 6 hours/overnight 				
		</li><br>
	</ul>

	<h4>Preparing the Blueberry Topping</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>

			While the cheesecake cools, make the sauce. In a small bowl, whisk <br>
			 together 1 tablespoon of water and the cornstarch. Set aside.
		</li><br>

		<li>

			Combine the sugar, remaining 1/2 cup of water and lemon juice in a medium-sized <br>
			saucepan over medium heat and stir to combine. Heat the mixture until the sugar is melted.

		</li><br>

		<li>

			Add the blueberries and continue to cook, letting the blueberries start to soften <br>
			and release their juices.

		</li><br>

		<li>
			When the blueberries’ juices have released and it’s starting to look more sauce-like, <br>
			add the cornstarch mixture. Continue cooking and remove from the heat when the sauce <br>
			begins to thicken and can coat the back of a metal spoon.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Assembling the Cheesecake</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			When both the cheesecake and sauce are cool and you’re ready to serve the cheesecake, <br>
			remove the cheesecake from the springform pan and place it on a serving dish. Spoon <br>
			the blueberry sauce onto the cheesecake and serve.
		</li>
	</ul>
